        This document describes procedures that make use of Autonomous System Provider 
        Authorization (ASPA) objects in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to verify the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) AS_PATH attribute of advertised routes.

        It also to some degree provides protection against prefix hijacks with forged-origin or forged-path-segment.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>
        The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as originally designed is known to be vulnerable to prefix (or route) hijacks and BGP route leaks <xref target="RFC7908"/>.   
        Some existing BGP extensions are able to partially solve these problems.
        For example, Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) based route origin validation (RPKI-ROV) <xref target="RFC6480"/> <xref target="RFC6482"/> <xref target="RFC6811"/> <xref target="RFC9319"/> can be used to detect and filter accidental mis-originations.
        <xref target="RFC9234"/> or <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-detection-mitigation"/> can be used to detect and mitigate accidental route leaks.
        While RPKI-ROV can prevent accidental prefix hijacks, malicious forged-origin prefix hijacks can still occur <xref target="RFC9319"/>.
        RFC9319 includes some recommendations for reducing the attack surface for forged-origin prefix hijacks.   
      </t>
      <t>
        This document describes procedures that make use of Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) objects <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile"/> in the RPKI to verify the BGP AS_PATH attribute of advertised routes. 
        These new ASPA-based procedures automatically detect invalid AS_PATHs in announcements that are received from customers, lateral peers (defined in <xref target="RFC7908"/>), transit providers, IXP Route Servers (RS), RS-clients, and mutual-transits.
        This type of AS_PATH verification provides detection and mitigation of route leaks and improbable AS paths.
        It also to some degree provides protection against prefix hijacks with forged-origin or forged-path-segment (<xref target="mitig1"/>).    
        The protections provided by these procedures (together with RPKI-ROV) are based on cryptographic techniques, and they are effective against a majority of accidental and malicious actions.
      </t>
      <t>
        ASPA objects are cryptographically signed registrations of customer-to-provider relationships and stored in a distributed database <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile"/>. 
        ASPA-based path verification is an incrementally deployable technique and provides benefits to early adopters in the context of limited deployment.
      </t>
      <t>
        The procedures described in this document are applicable only for BGP routes with {AFI, SAFI} combinations {AFI 1 (IPv4), SAFI 1} and {AFI 2 (IPv6), SAFI 1} <xref target="IANA-AF"/>.
        SAFI 1 represents NLRI used for unicast forwarding <xref target="IANA-SAF"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        For brevity, the term "provider" is often used instead of "transit provider" in this document; they mean the same.   
      </t>

    <section title="Anomaly Propagation" anchor="propagation">
      <t>
        Both route leaks and hijacks have similar effects on ISP operations - they redirect traffic and can result in denial of service (DoS), eavesdropping, increased latency, and packet loss.
        The level of risk, however, depends significantly on the extent of propagation of the anomalies.
        For example, a route leak or hijack that is propagated only to customers may cause bottlenecking within a particular ISP's customer cone, but if the anomaly propagates through lateral (i.e., non-transit) peers and transit providers, or reaches global distribution through transit-free networks, then the ill effects will likely be amplified and experienced across continents.
      </t>
      <t>
        The ability to constrain the propagation of BGP anomalies to transit providers and lateral peers - without requiring support from the source of the anomaly (which is critical if the source has malicious intent) - should significantly improve the robustness of the global inter-domain routing system.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
      <t>
        The use of the term "route is ineligible" in this document has the same meaning as in <xref target="RFC4271"/>, i.e., "route is ineligible to be installed in Loc-RIB and will be excluded from the next phase of route selection."

      <section title="BGP Roles" anchor="role">
        <t>
         For path verification purposes in this document, the BGP roles an AS can have in relation to a neighbor AS are customer, provider, lateral peer, RS, RS-client, and mutual-transit.
		 These relationships, except mutual-transit, are defined in <xref target="RFC9234"/>. 
         Mutual-transit ASes MAY export everything (both customer and non-customer routes) to each other, i.e., consider each other as a customer.
         For mutual-transit ASes, the customer-to-provider relationship applies in each direction.
       </t>
       <t> 
         All roles are configured locally and used for the registration of ASPA objects (<xref target="ASPA"/>, <xref target="rec1"/>) and/or for path verification (<xref target="verif"/>).
         The procedure of BGP Role capability <xref target="RFC9234"/> in the BGP OPEN message to verify the role with a neighbor is RECOMMENDED.
         The procedure is not applied for verifying a mutual-transit role since it is not specified in <xref target="RFC9234"/>.
         However, there is little concern about a pair of mutual-transit ASes, since they have a trusted relationship.   
         In fact, they are typically managed by a single entity. 
       </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Autonomous System Provider Authorization" anchor="ASPA">
      <t>
        An ASPA record is a digitally signed object that binds a set of Provider AS numbers to a Customer AS (CAS) number (in terms of BGP announcements) and is signed by the CAS <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile"/>.
        The ASPA attests that the CAS has a Set of Provider ASes (SPAS) as specified in the ASPA,
		and the SPAS applies to both {AFI, SAFI} combinations {AFI 1 (IPv4), SAFI 1} and {AFI 2 (IPv6), SAFI 1}.
        The definition of Provider AS is given in Section 1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile"/>.
        A function of a Provider AS is to propagate a CAS's route announcements onward, i.e., to the Provider's upstream providers, lateral peers, or customers.
        Another function is to offer outbound (customer to Internet) data traffic connectivity to the CAS.
        The ASPA object profile is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The notation (AS x, {AS y1, AS y2, ...}), is used to represent an ASPA object for a CAS denoted as AS x.
        In this notation, the set {AS y1, AS y2, ...} represents the Set of Provider ASes (SPAS) of the CAS (AS x).
        A CAS is expected to register a single ASPA listing all its Provider ASes (see <xref target="rec1"/>).
        If a CAS has a single ASPA, then the SPAS for the CAS is the set of Provider ASes listed in that ASPA.
        In case a CAS has multiple ASPAs, then the SPAS is the union of the Provider ASes listed in all ASPAs of the CAS.
      </t>
      <t>
        Verified ASPA Payload (VAP) refers to the payload in a cryptographically verified (i.e., X.509 valid <xref target="RFC3779"/> <xref target="RFC5280"/>) ASPA object.
        In the procedures for the AS path verification described in this document (<xref target="pair-validation"/>, <xref target="verif"/>), VAP-SPAS refers to the set of provider ASes derived from the VAP(s) of the CAS in consideration.
      </t>
    </section>

      <section title="ASPA Registration Recommendations" anchor="rec1">	  
        <t>
          An ASPA object showing only AS 0 as a provider AS is referred to as an AS0 ASPA.
		  A non-transparent Route Server AS (RS AS) is one that includes its AS number in the AS_PATH. 
		  Registering as AS0 ASPA is a statement by the registering AS that it has no transit providers, and it is also not an RS-client at a non-transparent RS AS. 
		  If that statement is true, then the AS MUST register an AS 0 ASPA including only AS 0 as a provider.
		</t>		  
        <t>
		  Normally, the Provider ASes of a CAS would be congruent for the address family combinations {AFI 1 (IPv4), SAFI 1} and {AFI 2 (IPv6), SAFI 1}.
          Exceptions to this are expected to be rare.		  
		  In any case, the CAS MUST list the union of all Provider ASes applicable to the address family combinations stated above in the SPAS and MUST also include any non-transparent RS AS(es) at which it is an RS-client. 
          In the procedures for the AS path verification described in this document (<xref target="pair-validation"/>, <xref target="verif"/>), the SPAS is always considered to be uniformly applicable to {AFI 1 (IPv4), SAFI 1} and {AFI 2 (IPv6), SAFI 1}.
		</t>
        <t>
		  A compliant AS, including a Route Server AS (RS AS), MUST have an ASPA.
          An AS SHOULD NOT have more than one ASPA.		  
          An RS AS SHOULD register an AS 0 ASPA.
		</t>
        <t>
		  As mentioned in <xref target="ASPA"/>, the set of provider ASes contained in the VAP(s) is referred to as the VAP-SPAS of the AS registering the ASPA(s).
		  Normally, a VAP-SPAS is not expected to contain both an AS 0 and other Provider ASes,
		  but an unexpected presence of AS 0 has no influence on the AS path verification procedures (see <xref target="pair-validation"/>, <xref target="verif"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
          Each of the two ASes in a mutual-transit pair MUST register its ASPA including the other AS in its SPAS. 
		  If one of the ASes in the pair does this registration but the other does not, that contributes to the risk of not getting the correct AS path verification result for routes that include the pair.     
        </t>
        <t>
          The ASes on the boundary of an AS Confederation MUST register ASPAs using the Confederation's global ASN as the CAS.
        </t>
        <t>
          As specified earlier, a compliant AS should maintain a single ASPA object that includes all its provider ASes, including any non-transparent RS ASes.
          Such a practice helps prevent race conditions during ASPA updates that might affect prefix propagation.
          The software that provides hosting for ASPA records SHOULD support enforcement of this practice.
          During a transition process between different certificate authority (CA) registries, the ASPA records SHOULD be kept identical in all relevant registries.
        </t>
      </section>
    <section title="Hop-Check Function" anchor="pair-validation">
      <t>
          Let AS(i) and AS(j) represent adjacent unique ASes in an AS_PATH, and thus (AS(i), AS(j)) represents an AS hop.
          A hop-check function, hop(AS(i), AS(j)), checks if the ordered pair of ASNs, (AS(i), AS(j)), has the property that AS(j) is an attested provider of AS(i) per VAP-SPAS of AS(i).
		  The VAP-SPAS table is assumed to be organized in such a way that it can be queried to check (1) if a specified CAS = AS(i) has an entry (i.e., SPAS listed), or (2) if for a given (AS(i), AS(j)) tuple, AS(j) is listed in the VAP-SPAS as a provider associated with CAS = AS(i).
		  A provider AS ID included in the SPAS can correspond to a Provider, a non-transparent RS, or a mutual-transit neighbor.
		  A non-transparent RS is effectively a Provider to its RS-client.		
		  Mutual-transit neighbors regard each other as a Provider (see Section 4).
		  The term "Provider+" in the definition of the hop-check function is meant to encompass all three possibilities: Provider, non-transparent RS, or mutual-transit neighbor.	
          This function is specified as follows:

    <section title="AS_PATH Verification" anchor="verif">
      <t>
        The procedures described in this document are applicable only to four-octet AS number compatible BGP speakers <xref target="RFC6793"/>.
        If such a BGP speaker receives both AS_PATH and AS4_PATH attributes in an UPDATE, then the procedures are applied on the reconstructed AS path (Section 4.2.3 of <xref target="RFC6793"/>).
        So, the term AS_PATH is used in this document to refer to the usual AS_PATH <xref target="RFC4271"/> as well as the reconstructed AS path.
      </t>
      <t>
        If an attacker creates a route leak intentionally, they may try to strip their AS from the AS_PATH.
        To partly guard against that, a check is necessary to match the most recently added AS in the AS_PATH to the BGP neighbor's ASN.
        This check MUST be performed as specified in Section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
        If the check fails, then the AS_PATH is considered a Malformed AS_PATH and the UPDATE is considered to be in error (Section 6.3 of <xref target="RFC4271"/>).
        The case of transparent RS MUST also be appropriately taken care of (e.g., by suspending the neighbor ASN check).
        The check fails also when the AS_PATH is empty (zero length) and such UPDATEs will also be considered to be in error.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-deprecate-as-set-confed-set"/> specifies that "treat-as-withdraw" error handling <xref target="RFC7606"/> SHOULD be applied to routes with AS_SET in the AS_PATH.
        In the current document, routes with AS_SET are given Invalid evaluation in the AS_PATH verification procedures (<xref target="Upflow"/> and <xref target="Downflow"/>). See <xref target="mitig"/> for how routes with Invalid AS_PATH are handled.
      </t>
      <t>
        In <xref target="Upflow"/> and <xref target="Downflow"/> below, the terms "upstream path" and "downstream path" generally refer to AS paths received in the upstream direction (from a customer or a lateral peer) and in the downstream direction (from a provider or a mutual-transit neighbor), respectively. An RS-client receiving a route from its RS is a special case where the algorithm for upstream paths is applied (<xref target="Upflow"/>).     
      </t>
    <section title="Algorithm for Upstream Paths" anchor="Upflow">
      <t>
        The upstream verification algorithm described here is applied when a route is received from a customer or lateral peer, or is received by an RS from an RS-client, or is received by an RS-client from an RS.
        In all these cases, the receiving/validating eBGP router expects the AS_PATH to consist of only customer-to-provider hops successively from the origin AS to the neighbor AS (most recently added).
      </t>
      <t>
        The basic principles of the upstream verification algorithm are stated here.  
        Let the sequence {AS(N), AS(N-1),..., AS(2), AS(1)} represent the AS_PATH in terms of unique ASNs, where AS(1) is the origin AS and AS(N) is the most recently added AS and neighbor of the receiving/validating AS. 
        For each hop AS(i-1) to AS(i) in this sequence, the hop-check function, hop(AS(i-1), AS(i)), must equal "Provider+" (<xref target="pair-validation"/>) for the AS_PATH to be Valid. 
        If the hop-check function for at least one of those hops is "Not Provider+", then the AS_PATH is deemed Invalid. 
        If the AS_PATH verification outcome is neither Valid nor Invalid (per the above principles), then it is evaluated as Unknown.
      </t>
      <t>
        The upstream path verification procedure is specified as follows:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            If the AS_PATH has an AS_SET, then the procedure halts with the outcome "Invalid".
          </t>
          <t>
            Collapse prepends in the AS_SEQUENCE(s) in the AS_PATH (i.e., keep only the unique AS numbers). 
            Let the resulting ordered sequence be represented by {AS(N), AS(N-1), ..., AS(2), AS(1)}, where AS(1) is the first-added (i.e., origin) AS and AS(N) is the last-added AS and neighbor to the receiving/validating AS.
          </t>
          <t>  
            If N = 1, then the procedure halts with the outcome "Valid". 
            Else, continue. 
          </t>
          <t>  
            At this step, N &ge; 2. If there is an i such that 2 &le; i &le; N and hop(AS(i-1), AS(i)) = "Not Provider+", then the procedure halts with the outcome "Invalid". 
            Else, continue.
          </t>
          <t>  
            If there is an i such that 2 &le; i &le; N and hop(AS(i-1), AS(i)) = "No Attestation", then the procedure halts with the outcome "Unknown". 
            Else, the procedure halts with the outcome "Valid".

      <section title="About Path verification at IXP RS AS and RS-Client" anchor="RS-client">
	<t>
	As stated above (top of <xref target="Upflow"/>), the algorithm for upstream paths is applied for path verification at IXP RS AS and RS-clients. 
	The justifications are as follow. 
	The RS-client to RS AS relationship is effectively a customer-to-provider relationship.
	The RS AS propagates the routes of an RS-client and its customers to other RS-clients. 
	An RS-client at a transparent RS effectively has a lateral peer relationship with other RS-clients that it connects to via the RS. 
	So, the algorithm for upstream paths clearly applies at an RS AS and at RS-clients of a transparent RS.
        </t>
        <t>
	Since an RS AS (transparent or non-transparent) does not have providers or lateral peers, an RS-client of a non-transparent RS expects an AS_PATH it receives to be consisting of only customer-to-provider hops successively from AS(1) (origin) the AS(N) (neighbor which is the RS AS). 
	This expectation is identical to what is expected when the UPDATE is received from a customer or lateral peer. 
	Hence, the algorithm for upstream paths applies also at an RS-client of a non-transparent RS.

      <t>
        The downstream verification algorithm described here is applied when a route is received from a transit provider or mutual-transit neighbor.
        As described in <xref target="rec1"/>, a sending mutual-transit AS acts towards its receiving mutual-transit AS in a manner similar to that of a provider towards its customer.
      </t>

        It is not essential, but the reader may take a look at the illustrations and formal proof in <xref target="sriram1"/> to develop a clearer understanding of the algorithm described here.

      <t>
        Looking at <xref target="fig2"/>, the UPDATE is received from a provider or a mutual-transit neighbor (i.e., AS(N) has that role in relation to the receiver).
        The AS_PATH may have both an up-ramp (on the right starting at AS(1)) and a down-ramp (on the left starting at AS(N)).
        The ramps are described as a sequence of ASes that consists of consecutive customer-to-provider hops.
        The up-ramp starts at AS(1) and each AS hop, (AS(i), AS(i+1)), in it has the property that hop(AS(i), AS(i+1)) = "Provider+" for i = 1, 2,... , K-1. 
        If such a K does not exist, then K is set to 1.
        The up-ramp ends (reaches its apex) at AS(K) because hop(AS(K), AS(K+1)) = "Not Provider+" or "No Attestation".
        The down-ramp runs backward from AS(N) to AS(L).
        Each AS hop, (AS(j), AS(j-1)), in it has the property that hop(AS(j), AS(j-1)) = "Provider+" for j = N, N-1,... , L+1. 
        If such an L does not exist, then L is set to N.
        The down-ramp ends at AS(L) because hop(AS(L), AS(L-1)) = "Not Provider+" or "No Attestation".
        Thus, the apex of the down-ramp is AS(L).  
      </t>
      <t>
        If there is an up-ramp that runs across all ASes in the AS_PATH (i.e., K = N), then clearly the AS_PATH is Valid.
        Similarly, if there is a down-ramp that runs across all ASes in the AS_PATH (i.e., L = 1), then also the AS_PATH is Valid.
        However, if both ramps exist in an AS_PATH with K &lt; N and L > 1, then the AS_PATH is Valid if and only if L-K &lt;= 1.
        Note that K could be greater than L (i.e., L-K has a negative value), which means that the up-ramp and down-ramp overlap, and that could happen when some adjacent ASes in the AS_PATH have mutual-transit relationship between them (i.e., include each other in their respective SPAS) (see <xref target="rec1"/>).
        If L-K = 0, it means that the apexes of the up-ramp and down-ramp are at the same AS.
        If L-K = 1, it means that the apexes are at adjacent ASes.
        In summary, the AS_PATH is Valid if L-K is 0 or 1 or has a negative value.

      Conforming implementations of this specification are not required to implement the AS_PATH verification procedures (step-wise lists) exactly as described in <xref target="Upflow"/> and <xref target="Downflow"/> but MUST provide functionality equivalent to the external behavior resulting from those procedures.
      In other words, the algorithms used in a specific implementation may differ, for example, for computational efficiency purposes, but the AS_PATH verification outcomes MUST be identical to those obtained by the procedures described in <xref target="Upflow"/> and <xref target="Downflow"/>.

    <t>
      The above applies to eBGP routers in general, including those on the boundary of an AS Confederation facing external ASes.

      If the AS_PATH is determined to be Invalid based on the verification procedures specified above (<xref target="verif"/>), then the route SHOULD be considered ineligible (see <xref target="terminology"/>). Also, for any route with an Invalid AS_PATH, the cause of the invalidity SHOULD be logged for monitoring and diagnostic purposes.

      The ASPA-based path verification procedures are able to check routes received from customers, lateral peers, transit providers, RSes, RS-clients, and mutual-transits.
      These procedures combined with BGP Roles <xref target="RFC9234" /> and RPKI-ROV <xref target="RFC6811"/> <xref target="RFC9319"/> can provide a fully automated solution to detect and filter many of the ordinary prefix hijacks, route leaks, and prefix hijacks with forged-origin or forged-path-segment (see Property 3 below).
    </t>
    <t>
	  The ASPA-based path verification has the following properties (detection capabilities):
    </t>
    <t>
	<list style="">

    <t>
		Property 1: Let AS A and AS B be any two ASes in the Internet doing ASPA (registration and path verification) and no assumption is made about the ASPA deployment status of other ASes. Consider a route propagated from AS A to a customer or lateral peer. The route is subsequently leaked by an offending AS in the AS path before being received at AS B on a customer or lateral peer interface. The ASPA-based path verification at AS B always detects such a route leak though it may not be able to identify the AS that originated the leak. This assertion is true even when the sender AS A (or receiver AS B) is an RS AS and the neighbor AS that AS A sent to (or AS B received from) is an RS-client.
    </t>
    <t>		
		Property 2: Again, let AS A and AS B be any two ASes in the Internet doing ASPA (registration and path verification) and no assumption is made about the ASPA deployment status of other ASes. Consider a route received at AS B on a customer or lateral peer interface that is a forged-origin prefix hijack involving AS A as the forged-origin. The ASPA-based path verification at AS B always detects such a forged-origin prefix hijack.
     </t>
	<t>		
		Property 3: This is an extension of Property 2 above to the case of prefix hijacking with a forged-path-segment. Such hijacking refers to the forging of multiple contiguous ASes in an AS path beginning with the origin AS. Again, let AS A and AS B be any two ASes in the Internet doing ASPA (registration and path verification). Let AS A's providers, AS P and AS Q, also be registering ASPA. No assumption is made about the ASPA deployment status of any other ASes in the Internet. Consider a route received at AS B on a customer or lateral peer interface that is a prefix hijack with a forged-path-segment {AS P, AS A} or {AS Q, AS A}. That is, the hijacker attaches this path-segment at the beginning of their route announcement. The ASPA-based path verification at AS B always detects such a forged-path-segment prefix hijack. For a chance to be successful (remain undetected by AS B), the hijacker may resort to a forged-path-segment with three ASes including a provider AS of AS P (or AS Q). But even that can be foiled (detected) if the providers of AS P and AS Q also register ASPA. Having to use a longer forged-path-segment to avoid detection by AS B diminishes the ability of the hijacked route to compete with the corresponding legitimate route in route selection.  
    </t>
    <t>		
		Property 4: Let AS A, AS B, and AS C be any three ASes in the Internet doing ASPA (registration and path verification). Consider a route propagated from AS A in any direction (i.e., to a neighbor AS with any of the BGP roles described in Section 2). Let the route be received at AS B from any direction and detected to be a route leak (this is facilitated due to enough ASes doing ASPA in the AS path from AS A to AS B). Assume that AS B's local policy is such that it only lowers the route's LOCAL_PREF <xref target="RFC4271"/>. Let such a route, selected and forwarded by AS B, be subsequently received at AS C. No assumption is made about the ASPA compliance of the ASes in the intervening path from AS B to AS C. The ASPA-based path verification at AS C always detects such received route as a leak regardless of the direction (type of peer) it was received from.
    </t>   
<!--  Unused text - will be deleted 
    <t>		
		Property 4: Let AS A and AS B be any two ASes in the Internet doing ASPA (registration and path verification). Assume that AS X is a neighbor to both AS A and AS B and not included in their ASPAs. AS X may or may not be doing ASPA. AS X receives a route from AS A and leaks it to AS B. The leak is always detectable at AS B (this is covered by Propert 1). In addition, if AS B happens to propagate the route, the leak is always detectable at any other AS doing ASPA along the path regardless of the direction (type of peer) it was received from.
    </t>
    <t>
		Property 5: Consider an ASPA island (i.e., a connected set of ASPA capable ASes). If any route is leaked by an AS that is a part of an ASPA island, and ASes immediately before and after it in BGP AS_PATH are also a part of the ASPA island, then ASPA-based path verification always detects such a route leak, no matter where it is received from (though it may not be able to identify the AS that originated the leak).
		
		Property 5: Consider an ASPA island (i.e., a connected set of ASPA capable ASes). Let AS A and AS B be any two ASes in the ASPA island. Consider a route propagated from AS A in any direction (i.e., to a neighbor AS with any of the BGP roles described in Section 2). The route is subsequently leaked by an offending AS in the AS path before being received at AS B from any direction. The ASPA-based path verification at AS B always detects such a route leak though it may not be able to identify the AS that originated the leak.

			</list>
	</t>
	<t>
      In the description of the properties listed above, the term "customer" can be replaced with "RS-client".
	</t>
	<t>
		An observation that follows from Property #1 above is that if any two ISP ASes register ASPAs and implement the detection and mitigation procedures, then any route received from one of them and leaked to the other by a common customer AS (ASPA compliant or not) will be automatically detected and mitigated. 
		In effect, if most major ISPs are compliant, the propagation of route leaks in the Internet will be severely limited. 
    </t> 
    <t>	
		The above properties show that ASPA-based path verification offers significant benefits to early adopters.  
		Limitations of the method with regard to some forms of malicious AS path manipulations are discussed in Section 12.

    <section title="4-Byte AS Number Requirement">
      <t>
        The procedures specified in this document are compatible only with BGP implementations that support 4-byte ASNs in the AS_PATH.
        This limitation should not have a real effect on operations since legacy BGP routers are rare, and it is highly unlikely that they support integration with the RPKI.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Correctness of the ASPA">
      <t>
        ASPA issuers should be aware of the implications of ASPA-based AS path verification.
        Network operators must keep their ASPA objects correct and up to date.
        Otherwise, for example, if a provider AS is left out of the Set of Provider ASes (SPAS) in the ASPA, then routes containing the CAS (in the ASPA) and said provider AS may be incorrectly labeled as route leaks and considered ineligible to be installed in Loc-RIB (see <xref target="mitig1"/>).
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Make Before Break">
      <t>
        ASPA issuers SHOULD apply the make-before-break principle while updating an ASPA registration.
		For example, when adding new Provider AS(es) in the SPAS, if the new ASPA is meant to replace a previously created ASPA, the latter SHOULD be decommissioned only after allowing sufficient time for the new ASPA to propagate to Relying Parties (RP) through the global RPKI system.

      <t>
        An AS may have a mitigation service provider (MSP) for protection from Denial of Service (DoS)/Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks targeting servers with IP addresses in the prefixes the AS originates. 
		Such an AS MAY include the MSP's AS in the SPAS of its ASPA. With such an ASPA in place, in the event of an attack, the AS (customer of the MSP) can announce more specific prefixes (over a BGP connection) to the MSP's AS for mitigation purposes, 
		and such announcements would be able to pass the ASPA-based path verification. It is assumed that appropriate ROAs are also registered in advance to facilitate this.

          BGPsec <xref target="RFC8205"/> was designed to solve the problem of AS_PATH verification by including cryptographic signatures in BGP Update messages.
          It offers protection against unauthorized path modifications and assures that the BGPsec Update actually traveled the path shown in the BGPsec_PATH Attribute.
          However, it does not detect route leaks (valley-free violations). 
          In comparison, the ASPA-based path verification described in this document detects if the AS path is improbable and focuses on detecting route leaks (including malicious cases) and forged-origin hijacks.

        <t>
          The Peerlock mechanism <xref target="Peerlock"/> <xref target="Flexsealing"/> has a similar objective as the APSA-based route leak protection mechanism described in this document.
          It is commonly deployed by large Internet carriers to protect each other from route leaks.
          Peerlock depends on a laborious manual process in which operators coordinate the distribution of unstructured Provider Authorizations through out-of-band means in a many-to-many fashion.
          On the other hand, ASPA's use of the RPKI allows for automated, scalable, and ubiquitous deployment, making the protection mechanism available to a wider range of network operators.
        </t>
        <t>
          The ASPA mechanism implemented in router code (in contrast to Peerlock's AS_PATH regular expressions) also provides a way to detect anomalies propagated from transit providers and IX route servers.
          ASPA is intended to be a complete solution and replacement for existing Peerlock deployments.

      While the ASPA-based mechanism is able to detect and mitigate the majority of mistakes and malicious activity affecting routes, it might fail to detect some malicious path modifications, especially for routes that are received from transit providers.
    </t>
    <t>
      Since an upstream provider becomes a trusted point, in theory, it might be able to propagate some instances of hijacked prefixes with forged-origin or forged-path-segment or even routes with manipulated AS_PATHs, and such attacks might go undetected by its customers.
      This can be illustrated with some examples.
      In <xref target="fig3"/>, normally the receiving/validating AS located at the lower left side should receive a route with AS_PATH {AS(5), AS(4), AS(3), AS(2), AS(1)} and it would be Valid (<xref target="Downflow"/>) given all the ASPAs that are shown in the figure.
      However, if AS(5) which is a transit provider to the validating AS acts maliciously and sends the route with a shortened AS_PATH such as {AS(5), AS(3), AS(2), AS(1)} or {AS(5), AS(2), AS(1)}, such path manipulation would be undetectable (i.e., the AS_PATH would be considered Valid).
      Also, if AS(5) were to perform a forged-origin hijack by inserting an AS_PATH {AS(5), AS(1)}, that would also be undetectable.

      While attacks like the examples above may happen, it does not seem to be a realistic scenario.
      Normally a customer and their transit provider would have a signed agreement, and a policy violation (of the above kind) should have legal consequences or the customer can just drop the relationship with such a provider and remove the corresponding ASPA record.
    </t>
    <t>
		The key properties or strengths of the ASPA method were described in <xref target="mitig1"/>.  
		If detection of any and all kinds of path manipulation attacks is the goal, then BGPsec <xref target="RFC8205"/> would need to be deployed complementary to the ASPA method. It may be noted that BGPsec in its current form lacks route leak detection capabilities.

    <name>Implementation Status</name>
      <t>
        This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft. The inclusion of this section here follows the process described in <xref target="RFC7942"/>.
        The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
        Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
        Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
        This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
        Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
      </t>
      <t>
        According to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
        It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".

      <ul>
        <li>
          A BGP implementation <xref target="bgpd">OpenBGPD</xref> (version 7.8 and higher), written in C, was provided by Claudio Jeker, Theo Buehler, and Job Snijders.
        </li>
        <li>
          The implementation NIST-BGP-SRx <xref target="BGP-SRx"/> is a software suite that provides a validation engine (BGP-SRx) and a Quagga-based BGP router (Quagga-SRx).
          It includes unit test cases for testing the ASPA-based path verification.
          It was provided by Oliver Borchert, Kyehwan Lee, and their colleagues at US NIST. 
          It requires some additional work to incorporate the latest changes in the draft specifications related to IXP RS AS and RS-client.

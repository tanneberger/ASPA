# AS_PATH Validation Algorithm

This python project has three different implementations of the AS_PATH verification algorithm.

- `simple.py` a highly simplified version
- `draft.py` a very faithfully implementation to the revision 16 of the draft
- `optimized.py` a optimized version of the algorithm


In `test.py` you find a lot of different that are run on the algorithm.

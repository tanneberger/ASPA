        This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content type for Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) objects for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
        An ASPA is a digitally signed object through which the issuer (the holder of an Autonomous System identifier), can authorize one or more other Autonomous Systems (ASes) as its upstream providers.
        When validated, an ASPA's eContent can be used for detection and mitigation of route leaks.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>
        The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is to improve routing security <xref target="RFC6480"/>.
        As part of this infrastructure, a mechanism is needed to facilitate holders of Autonomous System (AS) identifiers in their capacity as Customer to authorize other ASes as their Provider(s).
        A Provider AS (PAS) is a network that:
        <list style="letters">
          <t>offers its customers outbound (customer to Internet) data traffic connectivity and/or</t>
          <t>further propagates in all directions (towards providers, lateral peers, and customers) any BGP Updates that the customer may send.</t>
        </list>
        The digitally signed Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) object described in this document provides the above-mentioned authorization mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        An ASPA object is a cryptographically verifiable attestation signed by the holder of an Autonomous System identifier (hereafter called the "Customer AS", or CAS).
        An ASPA contains a list of one or more ASes, each listing meaning the listed AS is authorized to act as Provider network.
        When the CAS has multiple Providers, all Provider ASes are listed in the ASPA, including any non-transparent Internet Exchange Point (IXP) Route Server (RS) ASes.
        The common case for RS ASes at IXPs is to operate transparently (see Section 2.2.2.1 <xref target="RFC7947"/>), and in those instances the ASNs of IXP Route Servers are not listed as PAS in ASPAs.
	  </t>
      <t>
        The BGP Roles that an Autonomous System (AS) may have in its peering relationships with eBGP neighbors are discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification"/>.
        The details of ASPA registration requirements for ASes in different scenarios are also specified in that document.
        In addition, the procedures for verifying AS_PATHs in BGP UPDATE messages using Validated ASPA Payloads (VAPs) are described in that document.
      </t>
      <t>
        This CMS <xref target="RFC5652"/> protected content type definition conforms to the <xref target="RFC6488"/> template for RPKI signed objects.
        In accordance with Section 4 of <xref target="RFC6488"/>, this document defines:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
            The object identifier (OID) that identifies the ASPA signed object.
            This OID appears in the eContentType field of the encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo structure.
          </t>
          <t>
            The ASN.1 syntax for the ASPA content, which is the payload signed by the CAS.
            The ASPA content is encoded using the ASN.1 <xref target="X.680"/> Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) <xref target="X.690"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The steps required to validate an ASPA beyond the validation steps specified in <xref target="RFC6488"/>.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="ASPA Content Type" anchor="content-type">
      <t>
        The content-type for an ASPA is defined as id-ct-ASPA, which has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.49.
        This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo structure as well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo structure (see <xref target="RFC6488"/>).
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="ASPA eContent" anchor="content">
      <t>
        The content of an ASPA identifies the Customer AS (CAS) as well as the Set of Provider ASes (SPAS) that are authorized by the CAS to be its Providers.
      </t>
      <t>
        A user registering ASPA(s) must be cognizant of Sections 2, 3, and 4 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification"/> and the user (or their software tool) must comply with the ASPA registration recommendations in Section 4 of that document.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is highly recommended that for a given Customer AS, a single ASPA object be maintained which contains all providers, including any non-transparent RS ASes.
        Such a practice helps prevent race conditions during ASPA updates.
        Otherwise, said race conditions might affect route propagation.
        The software that provides hosting for ASPA records SHOULD support enforcement of this recommendation.
        In the case of the transition process between different CA registries, the ASPA records SHOULD be kept identical in all registries in terms of their authorization contents.
      </t>
      <t>
        The eContent of an ASPA is an instance of ASProviderAttestation, formally defined by the following ASN.1 <xref target="X.680"/> module:
      </t>

      <sourcecode type="asn.1" src="RPKI-ASPA-2023.asn"/>

      <t>
        Note that this content appears as the eContent within the encapContentInfo as specified in <xref target="RFC6488"/>.
      </t>

      <section title="version">
        <t>
          The version number of the ASProviderAttestation MUST be 1.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="customerASID">
        <t>
          The customerASID field contains the AS number of the Customer Autonomous System that is the authorizing entity.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="providers">
        <t>
          The providers field contains the listing of ASes that are authorized as providers.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each element contained in the providers field is an instance of ASID.
          Each ASID element contains the AS number of an AS that has been authorized by the customer AS as its provider or RS.
        </t>
        <t>
          In addition to the constraints described by the formal ASN.1 definition, the contents of the providers field MUST satisfy the following constraints:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The CustomerASID value MUST NOT appear in any ASID in the providers field.
          </t>
          <t>
            The elements of providers MUST be ordered in ascending numerical order.
          </t>
          <t>
            Each value of ASID MUST be unique (with respect to the other elements of providers).
          </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="ASPA Validation" anchor="validation">
      <t>
        Before a relying party can use an ASPA to validate a routing announcement, the relying party MUST first validate the ASPA object itself.
        To validate an ASPA, the relying party MUST perform all the validation checks specified in <xref target="RFC6488"/> as well as the following additional ASPA-specific validation steps.
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            The Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension <xref target="RFC3779"/> MUST be present in the end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the ASPA), and the Customer ASID in the ASPA eContent MUST be contained within the set of AS numbers specified by the EE certificate's Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension.
          </t>
          <t>
            The EE certificate's Autonomous System Identifier Delegation Extension MUST NOT contain any "inherit" elements.
          </t>
          <t>
            The IP Address Delegation Extension <xref target="RFC3779"/> MUST be absent.

        This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
        The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
        Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
        Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
        This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
        Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
      </t>
      <t>
        According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
        It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".
